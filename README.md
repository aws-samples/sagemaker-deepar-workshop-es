## Amazon SageMaker DeepAR Workshop Spanish

This workshop uses [Amazon SageMaker](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/index.html) to train a prediction model using DeepAR algorithm.
In this workshop we use the [Deutsche BÃ¶rse Public Dataset](https://registry.opendata.aws/deutsche-boerse-pds/) to train a model to predict securities transaction volume.

The workshop can be found in the file ```sagemaker-deepar.ipynb```, all the instructions are in spanish.

The file ```util.py``` contains utilitarian methods to help the user recover the data set files.

This Workshop was tested using the SageMaker kernel ```DataScience``` in an ```ml.c5.large``` instance.
